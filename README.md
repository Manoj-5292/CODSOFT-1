# Codsoft AI Internship Projects

## Task 1: Chatbot Implementation

**Description:**
Task 1 involves creating a chatbot capable of recognizing greetings, answering queries about itself, telling jokes, and handling various user inputs. The chatbot provides an interactive and engaging experience, enhancing fundamental AI programming skills.

**Usage:**
1. Run the Python script.
2. Chatbot greets and prompts for input.
3. Type 'exit' to end the conversation.
4. Restart by typing 'start' after ending the conversation.

## Task 2: Tic-Tac-Toe AI

**Description:**
Task 2 challenges you to implement an AI agent capable of playing Tic-Tac-Toe against a human player. The AI player utilizes algorithms like Minimax with or without Alpha-Beta Pruning to provide an unbeatable game experience. This project enhances understanding of game theory and basic search algorithms.

**Usage:**
1. Run the Python script.
2. Play Tic-Tac-Toe against the AI.
3. Experience strategic gameplay against an intelligent opponent.

## Task 3: Image Captioning

**Description:**
Task 3 involves combining computer vision and natural language processing to build an image captioning AI. Utilize pre-trained image recognition models like VGG or ResNet to extract features from images. Then, employ a recurrent neural network (RNN) or transformer-based model to generate descriptive captions for these images.

**Usage:**
1. Utilize pre-trained image recognition models for feature extraction.
2. Implement an RNN or transformer-based model for image caption generation.
3. Generate captions for images using the trained model.
