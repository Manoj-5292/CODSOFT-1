        "# **Description:**\n",
        "\n",
        "This project implements a Tic-Tac-Toe game where a human player can play against an AI opponent. The AI uses the Minimax algorithm with Alpha-Beta Pruning to make intelligent moves, ensuring that the AI player is unbeatable. The code is organized into separate functions for different tasks, including checking for a winner, detecting a draw, and implementing the Minimax algorithm. The game is played in a loop where the player and AI take turns making moves until there is a winner or a draw.\n",
        "\n",
        "# Steps:\n",
        "1. **Initialization:** Import necessary libraries and initialize the game board, AI symbol, and player symbol.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **Displaying the Board:** Implement a function to print the current state of the Tic-Tac-Toe board.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **Checking for a Winner:** Create a function to check if a player has won the game.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. **Checking for a Draw (Board Full):** Implement a function to check if the game board is full, resulting in a draw.\n",
        "\n",
        "5. **Minimax Algorithm with Alpha-Beta Pruning:** Implement the Minimax algorithm with Alpha-Beta Pruning to make the AI player's moves intelligent and unbeatable.\n",
        "\n",
        "6. **Finding the Best Move:** Create a function that utilizes the Minimax algorithm to find the best move for the AI player.\n",
        "\n",
        "7. **Game Loop:** Implement a game loop where the player and AI take turns making moves. Check for a winner or a draw in each iteration of the loop.\n",
        "\n",
        "8. **User Input and Validation:** Take input from the player and validate it to ensure it's a valid move.\n",
        "\n",
        "9. **AI Move:** Implement logic to make the AI player's move based on the Minimax algorithm's output.\n",
        "\n",
        "10. **Game End Conditions:** Handle conditions where the game ends, such as a player win, AI win, or a draw. Print appropriate messages when the game concludes.\n",
