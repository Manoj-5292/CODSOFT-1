        "\n",
        "**Step 1: Import Libraries**\n",
        "\n",
        "- Import the necessary libraries, including re for regular expressions, to enable pattern                   matching in the chatbot.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Step 2: Define Predefined Rules**\n",
        "\n",
        " - Define the predefined rules for the chatbot. These rules include patterns and corresponding responses for different user inputs, such as greetings, inquiries, and goodbyes.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Step 3: Define Chatbot Function**\n",
        "\n",
        " - Create the simple_chatbot function. This function takes user input, matches it with the predefined rules using regular expressions, and returns appropriate responses based on the patterns defined earlier.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Step 4: Interactive Conversation Function and Conversation Loop**\n",
        "\n",
        "-  Implement the interactive conversation function and the conversation loop. This section allows users to interact with the chatbot. It includes the logic for exiting the conversation, restarting, and handling different user inputs within the conversation loop."
